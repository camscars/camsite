<font size="+1"><p>My name is Cameron Woody and I am a 23 year old aspiring Python Developer from Vegas but currently residing in Reno, Nevada. Growing up, I was always interested in making video games and took elective courses in high school learning the basics of languages like Visual Basic and C++, but ultimately decided to pursue engineering instead. After messing around with Python a bit in my spare time, I realized I was having a lot more fun trying to figure out how to create these small projects that could help me in my everyday life and decided to try and pursue a career in development instead. Moving beyond the exposition, I am a huge sports fan (Go Eagles!) and fitness enthusiast. I also hope to be able to travel, which is part of what has made python development so attractive to me.  </p> <p> The countries I have been excited to visit are Venezuela, Columbia, and Argentina in Latin America; as for Europe, the Czech Republic and Estonia. These countries appeal to me because they arent the huge destinations that proably dont differ from home much (London, Paris, etc). I want to gain some perspective and see the world from the eyes of these smaller countries that may not have the same level of infrastructure I'm used to. Working to that end, I have been teaching myself Spanish, and I feel like I'm at a level where I can only progress further via immersion. End-game is to be fluent in English, Spanish, and French. </p> <p> Finally, to touch on my Eagles fandom, it's actually on a pretty ridiculous level. The blog section is likely to be exclusively about them. </p></p></font>
